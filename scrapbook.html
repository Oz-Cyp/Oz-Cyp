    <h3>A 'MANGAL' event can be dividied into 4 subdivisions:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1. Preperations</li>
        <br>
        <div>Preparation is the most crucial part since it determines the quality of the food.
            Quality of the meat you buy, coal you burn appetizers ... you name it.
            <div>
            </div>
            Usually man prepare the skewers while woman is busy with salad, rice houmus, etc..
        </div>
        <br>

        <br>

        <li>2. Cooking</li>

        <br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Appetizers</th>

        <br>
        <li>4. Afterparty</li>
        <br>
        <p> The worst part of the event as usually some unncesarily nostalgic people grab their 
        guitars to play traditional songs, one of which always have to be Meditarranean Sundance by Haluk Levent.
        </p>
